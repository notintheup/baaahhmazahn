# bamazon
An Amazon-like storefront with the MySQL skills you learned this unit. The app will take in orders from customers and deplete stock from the store's inventory. As a bonus task, you can program your app to track product sales across your store's departments and then provide a summary of the highest-grossing departments in the store.
# Bamazon Customer View 
* Running 'bamazonCustomer.js` will first display all of the items available for sale. This will include the ids, names, prices of products for sale and the stock quantity.

* The app will then prompt users with two messages.

   * The first will ask for the ID of the product that they would like to buy.
   * The second message will ask how many units of the product they would like to buy.

* Once the customer has placed the order, the application will check if the store has sufficient product items to meet the customer's request.

   * If not, the app will log the phrase `Insufficient quantity!`, and prevent the order from going through.
